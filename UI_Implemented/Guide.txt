Two data files provided in /Data, you can use them or any other data for the program. The only condition is a .csv file where the first column are 
the index of dataset(this gets dropped). 

Cluster amount and Iteration should be positive integers

For successful runs it must be done in steps
Fetch Input -> Apply Preprocessing -> Train kmeans -> predict profile -> output model -> load model


Output PCA Scatter plot and elbow graph are optional, they will create graphs in the Output folder after preprocessing is applied.
Predict profile is optional and creates a profile graph showing the dataset colored coded into profiles. 
Output model is optional and saves the tensorflow model in the output folder.
Load model loads the saved model from the same location, it lets you skip running train kmeans on subsequent runs.
To predict for a different dataset using the model you have to fetch a different dataset and run preprocessing on it. 

Let me know if anything breaks ill try to fix it.
